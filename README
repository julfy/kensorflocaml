This is a simple demo/proof-of-concept attempt to teach a model with keras using tensorflow backend and use it in OCaml.

Even though https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tensorflow-ocaml is not well developed it prooved to be enough and can be used for this minimal purpose of simply running a ready model.

Pre-trained model is provided for demonstration purpose (models/final_.pb). Trained on Imdb movie review dataset (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), even though very simple, provides accuracy of 86%.
Note that you will have to download and unpack the original dataset to '/data' if you want to play with preprocessor.

How to:
`opam install tensorflow devkit re2`
`make build`
`./dostuff.native -predict inp_good.txt`
